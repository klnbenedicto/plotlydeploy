# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
## Overview of Project

The purpose of this assignment was to complete Roza's dashboard. The final dashboard consists of a completed panel for demographic information and visualizations of the bacterial data for each volunteer that provided samples for the Belly Button Biodiversity Analysis. With this dashboard, volunteers will be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. 

The dashboard has a dropdown menu to select the Test Subject ID No. Once selected, the dashboard updates to display the demographic information for the test subject and several charts. The first chart is a bar chart displaying the Top 10 Bacteria Cultures found in that belly button. The second chart is a gauge chart that shows how many times per week the subject washes their belly button. The final chart is a bubble chart of the Bacteria Cultures Per Sample. 

I customized the page by adding a picture of belly buttons behind the title, customizing the layout of the data displayed, and making the page background a soothing blue color.
